To perform three algorithms we have to import some libraries:

* Pandas library is used to read the data set file which is in the format csv
* Numpy library is used to replacing the nan values and emply values in the data set
* train_test_split library is used to split the data set in test and train
* knn svc decision tree classifier used to implement the respective algorithms
* confusion matrix :A confusion matrix is a table that is used to define the performance 
                    of a classification algorithm.
* with the confusion matrix we can calculate accuracy,precision, recall,f1_score.
*Accuracy is defined as the ratio of correctly predicted examples by the total examples.
*Precision is a metric that tells us about the quality of positive predictions.
* Recall in this context is defined as the number of true positives divided 
  by the total number of elements that actually belong to the positive class.
*F1 score is defined as the harmonic mean between precision and recall.
KNN-Algorithm:
==============
*using test train library the data is divided into test and train data sets in the ratio 8:2
*after,the data is preprocessed and fitted into new train and test
*Using knn classifier taking n_neighbors=5 create a model named knn.
*fitting thr data into the model.
*after fitting our model is ready we can predict the output based on the input given.

SVM:
==============
* Svm is same as KNN but insted of KNN classifier we use SVC classfier
* SVC classifier divides the data into categories witha linear vector,parabolic vector.
* And from the confusion matrix we can obtain accuracy.

Decision Tree:
==============
* Decision is also same as Knn but instead of knn classifier we use decision tree classifier.
* Decision tree classifier divides the data in the criterion of entropy and gain.
* And from the confusion matrix we can obtain accuracy.

From the above three algorithms which has high accuracy it is preffered.

using classification report library it directly prits the accuracy,precision,recall score,f1 score
