Introduction:
=============
1) What is Hand writing recognition?

Handwriting recognition is the ability of a computer or device to take as 
input handwriting from sources such as printed physical documents, pictures and 
other devices, or to use handwriting as a direct input to a touchscreen and then 
interpret this as text.


2)what are the different ways to approach handwriting letter recognition?

Convolutional Neural network.
Semi Incremental Recognition.
Incremental Recognition.
K nearest neighbor.
Support vector machince.
decision trees.
Ensemble method.

In this project we are going to use K nearest neighbor,support vector machines,decision trees.

3) Is there any application or advantages with this?

Applications:
-------------
Applications of handwriting letter recognition are numerous: 1)reading postal addresses, 
                                                             2)bank check amounts, 
										 3)and forms
Advantages:
----------- 
Handwriting recognition helps to transform the writings in the papers to a text document 
format which can also be said as readable electronic format. 
By this way, historical facts can be stored, reviewed and shared easily 
too many people. Lastly, the advantage is textual studies.

DATA SET:
=========
* We have taken a data set called handwriting letter recognition
* This data set is taken from the kaggle.
* Our data set contains 20000 rows and 17 columns.
* The 16 columns contains Properties of the letter and other 1 column is Output letter
* The columns are letter	xbox 	ybox 	width 	height	onpix 	xbar 	
                              ybar 	x2bar	y2bar 	xybar 	x2ybar	xy2bar	
                              xedge 	xedgey	yedge 	yedgex

1. lettr capital letter (26 values from A to Z)
2. x-box horizontal position of box (integer)
3. y-box vertical position of box (integer)
4. width width of box (integer)
5. high height of box (integer)
6. onpix total # on pixels (integer)
7. x-bar mean x of on pixels in box (integer)
8. y-bar mean y of on pixels in box (integer)
9. x2bar mean x variance (integer)
10. y2bar mean y variance (integer)
11. xybar mean x y correlation (integer)
12. x2ybr mean of x * x * y (integer)
13. xy2br mean of x * y * y (integer)
14. x-ege mean edge count left to right (integer)
15. xegvy correlation of x-ege with y (integer)
16. y-ege mean edge count bottom to top (integer)
17. yegvx correlation of y-ege with x (integer)

System Model:
=============
* The given data set is divided into train and test test data set.
* The first block represents the training data...
* The data is trained....represented in second block.
* Using the appropriate Algorithm the test data is given as input...represented in 3 4 5 blocks
* After all...the algorithm predicts the output for the test data
* This all process represents a Model.

We are using 3 Algorithms for making a model:
1) K-nearest Neighbor:
-------------------------
* The data is divided not only in KNN, but also in SVN and Decision tree.
* Using the KNN Classifier taking n neighbors find the predicted for test data
* From predicted data find Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score etc.
* Specifically, four different distance functions, which are Euclidean 
  distance, cosine similarity measure, correlation, and Chi square, 
  are used in the k-NN classifier respectively

2) Support Vector Machines:
===========================
* Using the SVN Classifier we find the predicted for test data
* From predicted data find Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score etc.
* Specifically, different kernal functions, which are Polynomial,linear,Gaussian
  Radial Basis Function,Laplaas kernel are used in the SVN classifier respectively.

2) Decision Tree:
------------------
* Using the Decision Classifier we find the predicted for test data
* From predicted data find Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score etc.
* Specifically, different criterion functions, which are Entropy and gain
  are used in the Decision tree classifier respectively.
